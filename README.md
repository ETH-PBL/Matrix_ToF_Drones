<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The H-Watch is a fully open-sourde wearable long-lasting smart monitoring platform for health monitoring and tracking. Thanks to the integrated state-of-the-art NB-IoT cellular technology, it provides direct and secure cloud connectivity. It  is  based  on  widely  available  off-the-shelf components; however, it is designed with low-power and on-board intelligence in mind. Experimentalresults demonstrated only 5.9 mW of average power consumption, leading to a lifetime of 9 days on a small watch battery wothout, and up to 20 days with the solarenergy harvester.

## Hardware

### Components
The H-Watch is a highly integrated multi-sensor wearable platform which is built of the key components, listed below: 

* [MAX30101EFD+][max301010_url],  High-Sensitivity Pulse Oximeter and Heart-Rate Sensor for Wearable Health
* [LSM303AGR][lsm303agr_url],     Ultra-compact high-performance eCompass module
* [LPS22HB][lps22hb_url],         MEMS nano pressure sensor
* [LSM6DSM][lsm6dsm_url],         Ultra-low power, high accuracy and stability iNEMO 6DoF inertial measurement unit (IMU)
* [MP34DT05-A][mp34dt05_url],     MEMS audio sensor omnidirectional stereo digital microphone
* [BQ25570][bq25570_url],         Ultra Low power Harvester power Management IC with boost charger, and Nanopower Buck Converter
* [STM32WB55RG][stm32wb55_url],   Ultra-low-power dual core Arm Cortex-M4, Cortex-M0+ with 1 Mbyte of Flash memory, Bluetooth LE 5.2
* [BC95GJB-02-STD][bc95G_url],    Multi-band NB-IoT Module with Ultra-low Power Consumption

The H-Watchs housing, as well as its energy-saving memory LCD display, was taken from the [Matrix Power Watch][powerwatch_url] series 1.

### PCB 
The H-Watchs printed circuit board (PCB) is built of 6 Layers with a total board thichness of only 0.83mm. Further informations about the PCB can be found here:
